# Diabetes Prediction

This project is a Python-based interactive program designed to ask users a series of questions, store their responses in an array, and display them after all responses are collected. This program can serve as a basic foundation for projects that involve user input and data storage.

## Features

- **Question Prompting**: The program allows you to define a set of questions and then interactively asks each one to the user.
- **Response Storage**: Each user response is stored in a Python array (list) for easy access.
- **Display Responses**: At the end of the questionnaire, all responses are displayed for user review.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Download the Script**: Clone this repository or download the project script.
3. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python response_collection.py
   ```
4. **Respond to Prompts**: Enter your answers to the questions when prompted.
5. **View Responses**: After the questions, your responses will be displayed on the screen.

## Code Explanation

- `responses = []` initializes an empty list to store answers.
- A `for` loop iterates through each question, collects the user input, and appends it to the `responses` list.
- After the loop completes, it displays all collected responses to the user.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Question 1: Please enter your response: I like data science.
Question 2: Please enter your response: Python is my favorite language.
Question 3: Please enter your response: I would like to learn machine learning.

Here are the responses you provided:
Response 1: I like data science.
Response 2: Python is my favorite language.
Response 3: I would like to learn machine learning.
```

## Future Improvements

- Adding validation for user responses.
- Allowing custom question entry by the user.
- Expanding data storage options, such as exporting to a file.
